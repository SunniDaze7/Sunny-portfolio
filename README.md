## Portfolio Introduction

### About Me
- Hi! My name is Sunny Mcdougle. I am a full stack software engineer at HP Inc. I currenlty have on the job experience using technologies such as AWS cloud development, React, SAP services, and Javascript. Through my time in HP, I have been able to expand my knowledge in many areas of engineering and found one of my new favorite technologies cloud development. I hope to continue working with cloud and develop new programs and services that can better improve my day to day work.

### My Team
- I currently work on a technical Supply Chains team, developing and improving applications to make sure HP's supply and demand process runs smoothly and effeciently for our customers. My work directly involves HP Suppliers, partners, and vendors ensuring compliance in documention, payments, shipping, and manufacturing/

### My Goals
- Before my journey with HP, I was a self taught developer using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python with some skills in data analytics. I beleive my background in learning coding can bring new and important perspectives to HP Inc. I hope through this experience, I can expose engineers to a new way of learning and developing skills as well as creating services that work for all types of users.

### Thank you
- I want to give a thank you to the people who ensured my apprenticeship at HP was educational and beneficial to my career journey: my manager David King and mentor Spencer Keel. I also want to give a thank you to the people who made me job ready through my multiverse work so I had a great foundation to build upon: my multiverse coach David Todd, and teachers Austin Roberts and Elvis Garcia.
